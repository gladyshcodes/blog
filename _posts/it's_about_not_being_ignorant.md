# It’s not about money, it’s about not being ignorant

Sometimes, I asked myself ‘why’ about the most seemingly obvious questions. Like, Why do I need to earn money? Why do I need more of it? What’s the point?

Of all the questions I have yet to figure out as a young man, this one might be answered once and for all: pursue more not to be ignorant. I think that, almost always, the more a person earns, the more informed they are; the closer their inner world alights with reality. The closer their inner world aligns with reality, the better decisions they make. And the better decisions they make, the better outcomes they get, and the more money they earn

“Earning X amount per hour” is a good goal as it’s well defined, measurable, and serves as the starting point of all the change and growth that you will experience when figuring out a way to achieve it, learning new things in the process. You become a better person; your perspectives and worldview change. And that’s the most important thing. Money is a nice bonus

Outside of this, money is just paper that people have idolized. Paper that every country’s central bank can print. Some print more valuable paper. By the way, make sure you tap into the money flow from such countries
